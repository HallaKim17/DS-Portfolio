Built with **p5.js**, **Tone.js**, and **sketch.js** on **index.html**, MelOrbit turns the voices of a choir into planetary orbits where melodies revolve in harmony. Conduct your own universe of sound and explore how distinct tones form a celestial symphony. [Web App](http://hallakim17.github.io/ctp431/final_project/index.html)

## Micro Projects
- ### Statistics and Machine Learning
    - [Genetic Algorithm](https://github.com/archd3sai/Statistical-Methods/blob/master/genetic-algorithm.ipynb) : In this file, I have implemented simple genetic algorithm that finds out the list of numbers which equal to any specified number when summed together.
   
 
- ### Challenges
    - [SQL Challenges](https://github.com/archd3sai/SQL): This repository contains codes of online SQL challenges (From Hackerrank, Leetcode, Testdome, etc.) solved by me.
   
    
- ### Ranking Algorithms
    - [Ranking of NFL teams using Markov-chain methods](https://github.com/archd3sai/Ranking-of-NFL-Teams-using-Markov-method/blob/master/Ranking%20of%20NFL%20teams%20Report.pdf) : In this project I implemented and compared three stationary distribution of Markov-chain based approaches to rank 32 NFL (National Football League) teams from "Best" to "Worst" using the scores of 2007 NFL regular season.
